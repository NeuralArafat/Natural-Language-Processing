# Introduction To Natural Language Processing (NLP)
<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is about teaching computers to understand human language. This is not an easy task because human language is unstructured and diverse, unlike structured data like spreadsheets or databases. However, if computers can understand and process natural language data, it would be very helpful. There is a lot of natural language data available in various forms, such as literature pieces, which would be great if computers could understand.

To teach computers how to understand natural language, we can train models in different ways. However, there are various challenges involved, such as understanding the correct meaning of sentences, identifying named entities, predicting parts of speech, and resolving coreferences. Although it's difficult for a computer to extract the exact meaning from a sentence, we can train a model to categorize various parts of speech based on previously fed data and experiences.

To solve complex problems in NLP, we need to break down the process of understanding English for a model into a number of small pieces. This is called building an NLP pipeline. The pipeline has various steps, each of which contributes to the desired output at the end. However, to make the computer understand basic concepts of written language, we need to start by teaching it very basic language concepts.

In summary, NLP is about teaching computers to understand human language, which is a complex and challenging task. However, by breaking down the process of understanding language into small pieces, we can build an NLP pipeline that helps the computer process natural language data.</p>
